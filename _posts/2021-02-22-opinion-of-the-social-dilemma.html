<p>The Social Dilemma is a 2020 Amercian documentary-drama about how corporations treat their users as the product rather than the customer. It explores the threat of social media and surveillance capitalism.</p>

<h2>Opinion</h2>

<p>The film discusses many of the problems extraordinarily well however it is a bit stretched out. For someone very uneducated in how technology is exploitable this provides a fantastic overview. Unfortunately, I hoped they would share how to advocate for more control, promote ethical software or share general tips/guides.</p>

<p>The film succeeded in promoting the effects of using social media and started a discussion regarding it, Netfilx original branding and effective marketing might have contributed this (ironic due to Netflix's having the same flaws talked in the movie). However I feel like it requires more than that. There has to be more information about how your role can solve the problem. I see it discussed a lot but sadly it all fades away after a day.</p>

<p>I hope we can see more documentaries in the future of these problems since this topic requires everyone's attention.</p>
