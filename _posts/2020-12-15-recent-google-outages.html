<p>As you may know, recently (2020 December) <a
href="https://edition.cnn.com/2020/12/14/tech/google-youtube-gmail-down/index.html">Google
was hit with an outage</a> affecting many of its services like Google Suite,
YouTube, Classroom etc. This lasted for about an hour.</p>
<p>Being one of the most popular and massive technology company, this incident
did incite quite a lot of outrage in its users. Lots of people rely on Google's
free and paid software. They require it for school projects to governmental
work. They use Google's software and hardware in their homes. Does this raise
some red flags?</p>
<h1>The red flags</h1>
<p>Google owns around 88% of market share in the search engine space. With their
analytics software, ads, fonts and other APIs you could say they've invaded
loads of websites. This website once used Google fonts. They dominate in the
browser market with their Chrome browser. </p>
<p>Google's own ecosystem is part of lives, homes and companies. Their software
extends from work to home.</p>
<p>One company controlling most of the web seems disastrous. It's until that
company also has outages and privacy issues. They decide Mozilla's or
open-source's fate.</p>
<h1>What to do next?</h1>
<p>I despise the common thought that massive corporations with cute, relatable
or casual branding are trustable. Ignoring privacy in the 21st century will be
fatal for the information age. Is it necessary to trust faceless corporations
with your data for them to control what YouTube video to click next?</p>
<p>It's hard to live without the ecosystem but trying for a week will give a
better perspective. There are better alternatives out there, it's just that
people don't bother reviewing them correctly or using them.</p>
<br>
<p>This incident has proven that not only is privacy the issue, it's also the
promised 24/7 (99.9% uptime) accessibility of data. Google has proven that no
matter how big the company is, they can't have their services always online for
you. Check out <a href="https://privacytools.io">PrivacyTools.io</a> to read
