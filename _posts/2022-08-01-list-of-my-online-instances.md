Probably a year ago I made a little page on my website. It included a lengthy paragraph about internet freedom and a list of my self-hosted services. Since I had left-over server resources and was following all that internet privacy craze, I decided to publicise some of my self-hosted instances.

So, I left it all public in hopes of someone benefiting from them. I have no idea who used them or how much were they used. Since I had a strict no-log policy, I couldn't keep of watch. 

Fortunately, somewhere 5 months in I got a e-mail from someone saying they greatly benefited from using my Searx instance. This came as a happy surprise, I finally had feedback.

I have learned a lot during my time self-hosting and server administrating. The few past weeks all my instances reported 100% uptime. I will continue to keep that streak and also try to bring in more features. This time I'm also publicising my [server setup and config files](https://github.com/tenseoverflow/infrastructure). Everything will still stay the same, this time I'm making it easy for you to replicate. I might also include guides for self-hosting my instances in this blog.

With that out of the way, here is finally the list of the instances:

<ul>
    <li><a href="https://searx.hen.ee">Searx (meta-search engine)</a></li>
    <!--<li>Private <a href="ads.txt">ad-blocking</a> DNS (w/ DoH, DoT) server:<p> <strong>DoH:</strong> https://dns.hen.ee/dns-query <strong>DoT:</strong> tls://dns.hen.ee:853</p></li>-->
    <li><a href="https://ted.hen.ee">Teddit (Reddit proxy)</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://nit.hen.ee">Nitter (Twitter proxy)</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://meet.hen.ee">Jitsi (Zoom alternative)</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://status.hen.ee">Status page for all my instances</a></li>
</ul>
