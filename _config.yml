aboutme-text: >-
  <p>Mainly focusing on frontend web design, I'm currently studying to become a full-stack developer. Alongside I manage my own <a href="">online instances</a> of free and open source web applications.</p>

  <p>When I'm not, however, I write <a class="down" href="#recents">in my blog</a> about whatever pseudo-intellectual nonsense I have on my mind â€” mostly nerdy technological talk but could extend to a disquisition into random cultural topics.</p>

  <p>Send me an e-mail to <a href="mailto:contact@hen.ee">contact@hen.ee</a>, optionally encrypt it with <a href="https://hen.ee/hen.asc">GPG</a>.</p>

  <p>This website is <a class="outside" href="https://github.com/tenseoverflow/hen.ee">open-source</a> and runs on <a class="outside" href="https://www.websitecarbon.com/website/hen-ee/">sustainable energy</a>.</p>
