<h2>Info about my self-hosted instances</h2>
<p>One of the most vital things I've done during the pandemic and the privatization of my digital life is start self-hosting alternatives to popular services (such as Google). It's a great choice I made, and I encourage everyone to do something as well, however most of us don't have the time or courage needed to start administrating Linux servers.</p>
<p>That is why from 2021, I'll start providing some of my instances to the public for free. I don't like long and complicated ToS or Privacy Policies, so just make sure to be respectful towards the administrator and servers and I'll not track or sell your data. Here is a list of my currently self-hosted instances:</p>

<ul>
    <li><a href="https://searx.hen.ee">Searx (meta-search engine)</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://git.hen.ee">Gitea (Git)</a>*</li>
    <li>Mail (w/ webmail)*</li>
    <li>XMPP (no webclient)*</li>
    <li>Private <a href="ads.txt">ad-blocking</a> DNS (w/ DoH, DoT) server:</p><p><strong>IP:</strong> 129.159.194.167 <strong>DoH:</strong> https://dns.hen.ee/dns-query <strong>DoT:</strong> tls://dns.hen.ee:853</li>
    <li><a href="https://statuspage.freshping.io/53285-henee">Status page</a></li>
    <p>probably more to come...</p>
</ul>

<h2>Support my endeavours for a more decentralized web</h2>
<p>I keep my self-hosted instances of Searx; e-mail, XMPP, Gitea and more free-of-charge and private. I also have more projects and instances coming up as well. If you think I have helped you in any way, consider giving me a warm hug via e-mail or even more generous, donate (if you can afford it).</p>
