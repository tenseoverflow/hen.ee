Website hosted on https://hen.ee. For more info take a look in there. I use this repository for CI/CD.

This site uses [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) as it's static site generator.
Some inspiration taken from [Gesko](https://github.com/P0WEX/Gesko) for Jekyll integration.

For old design (might be a better start point), please checkout old branch.

## Installation

Assuming you have Ruby installed, you can run locally using these commands:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/tenseoverflow/hen.ee
$ cd ./hen.ee
$ bundle install
$ jekyll build
$ jekyll serve
```

To deploy, use a CDN (like Github Pages or Cloudflare Pages) or hosting provider of your choice.
